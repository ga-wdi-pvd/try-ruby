List **three** differences between Ruby and Javascript

```ruby
Syntax when create and inputing values into Json/Hash objects
Syntax overall seems a bit shorter and more closer to the english language
Do command seems more useful then a for loop because it has less steps
for i in staff
  console.log("hello" +staff[i])
  vs
for staff do |i|
  puts "hello" + i
```

List **three** similarities between Ruby and Javascript

```ruby
for loops, conditional logic, objects/key value pairs
```

What are your thoughts on ruby so far? **(2-3 sentences)**

```ruby
It seems like a more straight forward language in terms of manipulating primary data types, it doesn't seem to be rules by bracket or parenthesis, but I prefer javascript at the moment.
```
