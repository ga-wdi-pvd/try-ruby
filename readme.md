List **three** differences between Ruby and Javascript



```ruby
one differnce so far is I haven't seen {} brackets only regular ones []

second every thing in Ruby is a Object

Javascript seemsto be more front-end stuff and at the browser level and you can open up the Chrome console, and start typing in Javascript to edit  the web page you are on.

```

List **three** similarities between Ruby and Javascript

```ruby
One thing they have in common is the both use variables.

another thing in common is you can store arrays within varibales and call on them as needed

also You can make a function as a parameter
In javascript, any function can be made into a parameter.
In ruby, it is called code blocks. which seems very close to what javascript does just named differntly
