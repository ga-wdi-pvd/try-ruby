List **three** differences between Ruby and Javascript

```ruby
Ruby uses much more written language concepts for example the logical operators are "or", "and" and "not" as opposed to javascripts || && and !==
Ruby has alot more control over what you can do with data types. strining methods to an object to manipulate it seems to be Ruby's focus and strength.
Ruby uses print instead of console.log(omg this is amazing)

```

List **three** similarities between Ruby and Javascript

```ruby
Both programming languages operates on primitive data types such as number(ruby calls them integers), strings, booleans.
Both programming languages uses type specific methods such as ".reverse" and ".length" are both methods associated to string type data and ".max" is associated to integers.
Both programming languages shares the concepts of "Flow of control" with branching and loops.

What are your thoughts on ruby so far? **(2-3 sentences)**

```ruby
I think ruby is very cool. it definitely has a much more simple approach, which is probably due to its readability. And that simplicity does not seem to get in the way of its capabilities as far as writting and computing functions similar to Javascript, from what ive seen so far.
